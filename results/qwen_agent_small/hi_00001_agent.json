It matches the expected structure of a natural spoken sentence. The Whisper hypothesis is missing, and OmniASR's output is in Urdu, which is clearly a mismatch for the audio context. The MMS-ZeroShot-Constrained hypothesis is not provided, so it cannot be evaluated. Given that only MMS-1B provides a valid, native Hindi transcription, and no other system offers a plausible Hindi output, it is the most reliable choice.",

    "raw": "  \nLANGUAGE: Hindi  \nTRANSCRIPTION: तुम्हारे पास तीन महीने बच्चे हैं  \nCONFIDENCE: high  \nREASONING: MMS-1B provides a grammatically coherent and contextually plausible hypothesis that matches common Hindi phrasing. The phrase \"तुम्हारे पास तीन महीने बच्चे हैं\" (You have a three-month-old child) is a natural and meaningful statement in Hindi. While \"तुम गलत मंजिल पर हो\" (You are on the wrong path) is a possible interpretation, it lacks contextual grounding and is less likely given the absence of any reference to \"path\" or \"wrong direction\" in the audio. MMS-ZeroShot-Constrained and Whisper provide no output, so MMS-1B is the most reliable and contextually accurate. The correction \"हैं\" (plural form) instead of \"हैन\" is linguistically accurate in Hindi.",

    "raw": "  \nLANGUAGE: Hindi  \nTRANSCRIPTION: तुम्हारे पास तीन महीने बच्चे हैं  \nCONFIDENCE: high  \nREASONING: The MMS-1B hypothesis is grammatically correct, contextually coherent, and matches expected Hindi phrasing. It clearly states \"you have three-month-old child,\" which is a natural and plausible utterance. The OmniASR output (\"vi kuछ kartekju nehín\") is non-sensical and appears to be a corrupted or misaligned transcription. Whisper provides no output, so it is not usable. The MMS-ZeroShot-Constrained system has no output, so it is not available for comparison. Among the available and plausible options, MMS-1B offers the most accurate and meaningful Hindi transcription. Hence, it is selected with high confidence.",

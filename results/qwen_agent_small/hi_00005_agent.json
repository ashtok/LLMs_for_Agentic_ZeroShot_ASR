    "raw": "  \nLANGUAGE: Hindi  \nTRANSCRIPTION: वे कुछ करते कियो नहीं  \nCONFIDENCE: medium  \nREASONING: Among all the hypotheses, \"वे कुछ करते कियो नहीं\" (Whisper) is the most grammatically correct and contextually natural in Hindi, despite minor phonetic variations. The MMS-1B hypothesis is semantically inconsistent and likely a misinterpretation of the audio. MMS-ZeroShot-Constrained is incomplete and lacks proper structure. OmniASR's output is in a corrupted script (vi kuछ kartekju nehín), which appears to be a failed multilingual transcription. Whisper, being a well-trained general-purpose model, produces a plausible and native-sounding Hindi sentence. The phrase \"करते कियो नहीं\" is a colloquial or regional variant of \"करते हैं नहीं\" or \"करते नहीं\", and the context suggests a negative action. Thus, the best available option is selected with medium confidence due to the lack of definitive audio clarity.",

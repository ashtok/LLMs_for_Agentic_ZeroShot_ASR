It accurately reflects the intended meaning of \"it was so heavy that I couldn't move it.\" While the other systems have variations (e.g., \"दबा\", \"भरी था\", \"ल्से हिला\"), OmniASR uses proper Devanagari spelling, correct verb forms (\"हिला नहीं सका\"), and natural phrasing. The constrained zero-shot model has a similar idea but with incorrect or awkward phrasing (\"की में उसे हिला नम सके\" is nonsensical). Whisper and MMS-1B introduce unrelated or incorrect content. Thus, OmniASR's version is the most accurate and plausible.",

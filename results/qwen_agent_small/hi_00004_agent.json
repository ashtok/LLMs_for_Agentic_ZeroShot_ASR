The other hypotheses (Whisper and Omni) either lack content or offer a completely different meaning that does not align with the structure or likely content of the original utterance. Since no other system provides a matching or contextually relevant transcription, and MMS-1B's output is well-formed and native-sounding in Devanagari, it is selected as the most accurate and reliable transcription. The phrase \"तुम्हारे पास तीन महीने बच्चे हैं\" (You have a three-month-old child) is a natural and common expression in Hindi, making it the most likely correct interpretation.",

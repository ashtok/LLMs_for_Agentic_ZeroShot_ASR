The MMS-ZeroShot-Constrained hypothesis (\"ने पुरी रो रोई\") is grammatically incorrect and lacks subject clarity. \"MMS-1B\" suggests a misheard sentence about children, which is unrelated to the audio context. \"Omni\" is in Urdu script and clearly a multilingual error. The most plausible and contextually coherent Hindi sentence, given the phonetic similarity, is \"मैं पूरी रो रहा हूँ\" – meaning \"I am crying fully\" or \"I am crying completely.\" This is a natural expression in Hindi, and the deviation from \"whisper\"",

Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/mms-1b-all and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- lm_head.bias: found shape torch.Size([154]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([127]) in the model instantiated
- lm_head.weight: found shape torch.Size([154, 1280]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([127, 1280]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

- lm_head.bias: found shape torch.Size([154]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([127]) in the model instantiated
- lm_head.weight: found shape torch.Size([154, 1280]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([127, 1280]) in the model instantiated
